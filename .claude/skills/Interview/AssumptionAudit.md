# Assumption Audit

Catches assumptions — both Claude's and the user's — before they compound into bad recommendations.

---

## Purpose

Prevent Claude from filling in gaps with assumptions that may not match the user's intent, even when those assumptions don't violate stated constraints.

**The problem it solves:** User asks about "team structure." Claude assumes they mean a flat hierarchy when user actually meant a matrix organization. No stated constraint was violated, but the assumption was wrong.

---

## The Three Questions

Before stating anything the user didn't explicitly say, ask internally:

### 1. "Am I assuming or did the user say this?"

If the user didn't say it, this is an assumption. Challenge it.

### 2. "Could a reasonable person interpret this differently?"

If yes, ambiguity exists. Surface it before proceeding.

### 3. "What am I NOT considering?"

What alternative interpretations exist? If multiple are valid, don't pick one silently.

## Writing Out Assumptions

**For EVERY recommendation**, explicitly write out the assumptions it rests on. Don't just flag ambiguous ones — enumerate ALL assumptions, even ones that seem obvious.

**Two layers to write out:**

1. **Your assumptions** about the situation
2. **What the user appears to assume** — beliefs embedded in their message they may not realize they're making

Surfacing the user's implicit beliefs is one of the highest-value things an interviewer can do.

**Example** — User says: "Train Qwen3-4B on my customer support tickets to auto-classify priority."

> **My assumptions:**
> - Chat format data with system prompt defining the classifier role
> - "Priority" means a small set of discrete labels (e.g., low/medium/high/critical), not a continuous score
> - eval_loss is insufficient — this needs a custom accuracy metric since it's classification
> - The user has labeled examples where a human assigned the priority
>
> **You appear to assume:**
> - The existing labels are consistent (support ticket priority labels are often subjective and noisy across agents)
> - 4B is the right model size — have you checked if 0.6B would suffice for a classification task this narrow?

## Surfacing Ambiguity

When a specific assumption is uncertain, escalate beyond just listing it:

**State it:** "I'm assuming [X]. Is that correct, or did you have something different in mind?"

**Offer alternatives:** "There are a few ways to interpret this: A) [interpretation], B) [interpretation], C) [interpretation]. Which did you mean?"

**Check before elaborating:** "Before I explain how this would work — are you thinking [X] or [Y]?"

**For structural ambiguity** (where the shape of the solution matters — layouts, schemas, hierarchies), use a Showpiece question with markdown previews. See QuestionGuidelines.md for the technique.

## Common Assumption Traps

### The "Standard Approach" Trap
Claude knows common patterns and assumes they apply. The standard approach for business strategy, document structure, technical architecture, or design may not fit THIS user's situation.

**Challenge:** Did the user ask for the standard approach, or am I defaulting to it?

### The "Obvious Default" Trap
Claude fills in "obvious" choices without checking — the default tool, the default structure, the default format.

**Challenge:** Did the user specify this, or am I choosing for them?

### The "Completing the Picture" Trap
User asks a narrow question. Claude draws a complete picture, adding details the user didn't request.

**Challenge:** Did user ask for the full picture or just one part?

---

## When NOT to Trigger

- **User explicitly stated it** — don't challenge what was said directly
- **Already confirmed earlier** — don't re-check what was settled
- **Objective facts** — don't challenge things that are simply true
- **Trivial details** — don't over-challenge minor choices

---

## Integration with Verification Gate

| Mechanism | What It Checks |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Verification Gate** | Does this violate STATED constraints? |
| **Assumption Audit** | Am I ASSUMING things? What is the USER assuming? |

Together they prevent both assumption drift AND constraint drift.

## Assumption Audit Checklist

Before any recommendation involving unspecified details:

- [ ] Identified what I'm about to assume
- [ ] Checked if user actually stated this
- [ ] Considered alternative interpretations
- [ ] Surfaced the assumption explicitly
- [ ] Got user confirmation before proceeding

**When in doubt, ask.** It's better to ask a "dumb" question than to build on a wrong assumption.
